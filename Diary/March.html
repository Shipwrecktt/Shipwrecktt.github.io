<h3>7/3/2024</h3>
<p>
It has been a week or two since I edited this site, and I have been quite busy<br>
with other things like studying. I have been studying some GCSE computer science books,<br>
and I would say it has been going well. I recently bought a ThinkPad X270, and it works<br>
well. It came with the bigger battery, and so far, the battery life has been amazing.<br>
I have used it for about 2 hours at one point just messing around with stuff, and it<br>
was only at about 80%. I have also bought a dock for my ThinkPad; it was worth the<br>
money because this thing is so cool. It has all the ports I would ever need, and it's<br>
just a nice place to put it when I am recharging it.<br><br>
 
I have been thinking of some ideas for programs I can write in C. So far, I have a few, but some<br>
of them are out of my skill range, but one I do think I am able to do is a text editor. I have<br>
played around a bit, and I kind of know how to make a text editor, but I need more time to fully<br>
figure it out. I definitely will work on this idea more in the future when I have more time to do
so.<br><br>

But that is all for now, I have some more free time since my schedual has been filled up a
little<br>
bit so I will be doing some more programming and hopefully making this website look more<br>
styalish, that is all for now, thank you for reading.
