            Hi there, I'm Shipwreckt (not my real name), and this is my website. As you probably know I love tech, GNU/Linux, <br>
            and other programming-related things, so have a look around and see what you find, but for the most part, I just put<br>
            whatever on this website. But I do document my programmes here, so if you are interested in that, head over to my <a href="projects.html">projects</a>
            </p>

        <h1>I have a new domain name, still need to set up my server but when I am done this site will go down!</h1>
