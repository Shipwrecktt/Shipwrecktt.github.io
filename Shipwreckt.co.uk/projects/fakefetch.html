<h1>Fakefetch</h1>

<p>
What is Fakefetch? <br>
Fakefetch is a light weight, hackable command line utility that tells the user infomation about<br>
the hardware you are using and infomationabout what Linux distro you are using. The reason why I have<br>
made fakefetch is because I wanted to make an alternative to neofetch.<br>
</p>
<p>
Why Fakefetch?<br>
The reason why you should choose fakefetch is becasuse it is very hackabe and lightweight, it is also<br>
written in bash because of how small it is so it is easy to read. I would highly suggest you make your<br>
own variant of fakefetch so you can learn and personalize it to your liking!<br>
</p>
<p>
How to install<br>
To install fakefetch it is quite easy all you need to do is clone the gitlab repo at<br>
https://gitlab.com/Shipwreckt/fakefetch and then cd into fakefetch, I suggest editing<br>
how your fakefetch looks like with your own ascii art, but when you are done run ./setup.sh<br>
then the install script should take care of everything else! Now if you run fakefetch.sh it should work.<br>
</p>
<p>
Looks messed up?<br>
If it looks odd you can edit it at /usr/local/bin/fakefetch.sh, it is probably messed up because the art<br>
is too big so I suggest downscaling the ascii art if this is the case there are websites out there to make<br>
an image into art I would suggest https://www.asciiart.eu/image-to-ascii or if you think you are skilled<br>
enough try yourself!
</p>
<p>
Extra
If you want it to run whenever you open a terminal it is very simple you just need to edit<br>
your .bashrc by doing echo "fakefetch.sh" >> ~/.bashrc and then boom it should work!<br>
