        <img src="../Images/qtile/qtile.png" style="max-width:30%; height:auto;">
        <p>There is not much to say about my Qtile config but I have modified it to my liking in a few ways.</p>

        <h2><u>Shortcuts</u></h2>
        <p>
            I have added three custom shortcuts so I can launch Discord, Firefox, Steam, and code using this command. <br>
        <img src="../Images/qtile/shortcuts.png" style="max-width:70%;" title="This is my shorcut list">
        This tells Qtile that if I press mod4+x (mod4 is the Windows key), it will launch whatever app I have bound to it, for example<br>
        f for Firefox and such. Overtime I will probably add more apps to this list because it is so much faster than scanning for the<br>
        applocation name in the run menu, and it has increased my work flow by a lot.
        </p>

        <h2><u>Groups</u></h2>
        <p>I have assigned groups their own names so I can stay more organized. It also just looks better than numbers, in my opinion.</p>
        <img src="../Images/qtile/Group.png" style="max-width:70%;" title="Diffrent group names">
        <p>I am thinking of changing the group names and the order they are in to fit my work flow better, but for now I will just<br>
        stick with it because it is working as intended, but in the future I will probably change it up a little bit. </p>

        <h2><u>Layouts/widget defaults</u></h2>
        <p>Here are my layouts that I have chosen and configured to what is best for me.
            <img src="../Images/qtile/layouts.png" style="max-width:70%;" title="Diffrent layours"><br>
            I have chosen the MonadTall layout as my primary layout because I have a large primary monitor and I personally like <br>
            the spaces that MonadTall provides, and it is more stylish. But I still have max and colums enabled, just in case I need them. <br>
            I want to use them; I mainly use them on my second monitor. Also, due to me having a bigger monitor, I have chosen <br>
            a larger font in bold so I am able to see it.
        </p>
        <p>This is why MonadTall looks like on my main monitor</p>

        <h2><u>Widgets</u></h2>
        <h3><u>Status bar</u></h3>
        <p>I am going to go through my widgets now. If one is not mentioned that is because it has default settings.</p>
        <img src="../Images/qtile/widgetbar.png" style="max-width:70%;" title="Widgets">
        <p>
            I have put my status bar at the top of my screen because it is easier to see than at the bottom (in my opinion).
            I have also changed the colours of the windows that I am currently on, and I have changed it from a box selection<br>
            to a block selection so that it is more noticeable, and for Styal, I have also changed the active and inactive windows<br>
            to the same colour because I do not personally want them to be different. I think they look good as just white throughout. 
        </p>

        <h3><u>Background colour</u></h3>
        <p>The background colour for my status bar is #1d141d. A very dark purple. I chose this because it matches my aesthetic. <br>
            The only widget to differentiate this colour standard is the 'widget.windowname' because there needs to be some variation in my status bar.</p>

        <h3><u>Clock</u></h3>
        <p>I have changed the date format and the time format to day, month, year, and 24 hour time.
            widget.Clock(format="%d-%m-%Y %H:%M",), This is how I achieved that.
        </p>
        
        <h2><u>Start-up programmes</u></h2>
        <p>
            I have a few startup programs. I have Nitrogen, so I can have a wallpaper on startup instead of manually setting it every single time<br>
            I also have Picom for my composer; I only have it so I can see through terminals because they just feel and look better<br>
            And my last startup programme is Redshift. I have this because it is easier on my eyes if I am using the computer for a long time.

        <p>
              For it to work you will need <a href="https://pypi.org/project/psutil/">psutil</a>, it is avaliable in most package managers.<br>
