<h2>What is Qtile</h2>
<p>
Qtile is a desktop enviroment wrote in python. If you know anything about programming and the programming<br>
world you might be thinking well isent python slow? Well it is but in this case it is extreamly fun because<br>
Python is a very felable and easy language to learn and if you see my gitlab you can tell I really like<br>
chaning my Qtile config. This is due to change of taste over time like when I started with Qtile I did not<br>
have gaps inbetween windwos but I do now, I also have everything colour coded to my liking (Magenta)<br><br>
