    <h2>5th February</h2>
    <p>It has been a few days since the last one of these. I was hopeing that I would get these out daily, but being sick does not really help with that. I have not done much<br>
    programming in the last few days; the only programming that I have been doing is HTML and CSS for this website and a little bash. But tomorrow I will do some more programming<br>
    in C mainly. I have made my own install script for programmes that are found on my Linux desktop. This install script only installs packages, which means that I have a big list of<br>
    programmes I use on any of my Qtile desktops, like Yay, an Aur helper (Arch user reposetry). I have also automated the fakefetch install, so there is an install script to make<br>
    it more easy to make fakefetch a command that you can run. But that is really all as normal. Thank you for reading!

    <h2>1st February</h2>
    <p>First post on this website! Well, today I have not done too much development I have switched over to brave and changed a keybind in my qtile config, but I<br>
        have spent a little bit of time learning how to program in the C programming language witch has been fun and i do belive I will be able to develop things very<br>
        soon but I do have some more learning to do, but I am determined to do this so I am able to make faster and more advanced programs. I do have some ideas for projects<br>
        I could do in C. For example, right now I would like to program a text editor. I think that would be a fun little project to do, but we will see how that goes!<br>
        I might also learn Vim because, from what I have learned, it is an amazing text editor, I hear lots of good things about it, and I love the idea of a lightweight,<br>
        effective text editor. But that is all for today. Thank you for reading!<br>
